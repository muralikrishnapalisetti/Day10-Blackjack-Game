# 🃏 Blackjack Game – Day 10 of 100 Days of Code

🎮 **Built with Python | Day 10 Challenge Project**


## 🎯 About the Project

On Day 10 of my [#100DaysOfCode], I built a fully functional **Blackjack Game** using Python!

This project was a fun and challenging way to apply everything I’ve learned so far — from loops and conditionals to functions and list manipulation. The game simulates the classic Blackjack experience where the goal is to beat the dealer without going over 21.

## 🚀 Features

- Deal cards randomly to user and dealer 🎲
- Calculate scores and handle game logic 💡
- Keep drawing or hold your hand 🖐️
- Dealer auto-plays by standard rules 🧠
- Clear win/loss logic with print-based UI ✅


## 🧠 Skills Used

✔️ Python Functions  
✔️ Conditional Statements  
✔️ While Loops  
✔️ List Manipulation  
✔️ Game Logic Handling  
✔️ User Input Handling  

## ▶️ How to Play

1. Run the game in your Python environment.
2. You'll be dealt two cards. Decide whether to `hit` (draw another) or `pass`.
3. Try to beat the dealer without going over 21.
4. Dealer plays by standard Blackjack rules.
